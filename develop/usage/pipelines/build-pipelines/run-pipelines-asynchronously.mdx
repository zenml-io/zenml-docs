By default your pipelines will run synchronously. This means your terminal will follow along the logs as the pipeline is being built/runs.

This behavior can be changed in multiple ways. Either the orchestrator can be configured to always run asynchronously by setting `synchronous=False`. The other option is to temporarily set this at the pipeline configuration level during runtime.


```py
from zenml import pipeline

@pipeline(settings = {"orchestrator": {"synchronous": False}})
def my_pipeline():
  ...
```

or in a yaml config file:

```yaml
settings:
  orchestrator.<STACK_NAME>:
    synchronous: false
```
