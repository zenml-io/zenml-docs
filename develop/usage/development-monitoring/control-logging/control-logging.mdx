ZenML produces various kinds of logs:

* The [ZenML Server](/versions/0.66.0/getting-started/deploying-zenml) produces server logs (like any FastAPI server).
* The [Client or Runner](/versions/0.66.0/how-to/configure-python-environments#client-environment-or-the-runner-environment) environment produces logs, for example after running a pipeline. These are steps that are typically before, after, and during the creation of a pipeline run.
* The [Execution environment](/versions/0.66.0/how-to/configure-python-environments#execution-environments) (on the orchestrator level) produces logs when it executes each step of a pipeline. These are logs that are typically written in your steps using the python `logging` module.

This section talks about how users can control logging behavior in these various environments.
