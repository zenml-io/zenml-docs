There are a few general rules when it comes to settings and configurations that are applied in multiple places. Generally the following is true:

* Configurations in code override configurations made inside of the yaml file
* Configurations at the step level override those made at the pipeline level
* In case of attributes the dictionaries are merged

```py
from zenml import pipeline, step
from zenml.config import ResourceSettings


@step
def load_data(parameter: int) -> dict:
    ...

@step(settings={"resources": ResourceSettings(gpu_count=1, memory="2GB")})
def train_model(data: dict) -> None:
    ...


@pipeline(settings={"resources": ResourceSettings(cpu_count=2, memory="1GB")})
def simple_ml_pipeline(parameter: int):
    ...

# ZenMl merges the two configurations and uses the step configuration to override
# values defined on the pipeline level

train_model.configuration.settings["resources"]
# -> cpu_count: 2, gpu_count=1, memory="2GB"

simple_ml_pipeline.configuration.settings["resources"]
# -> cpu_count: 2, memory="1GB"
```
