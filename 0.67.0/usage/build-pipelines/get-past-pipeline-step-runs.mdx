In order to get past pipeline/step runs, you can use the `get_pipeline` method in combination with the `last_run` property or just index into the runs:

```py
from zenml.client import Client

client = Client()

# Retrieve a pipeline by its name
p = client.get_pipeline("mlflow_train_deploy_pipeline")

# Get the latest run of this pipeline
latest_run = p.last_run
# Alternatively you can also access runs by index or name
first_run = p[0]
```
