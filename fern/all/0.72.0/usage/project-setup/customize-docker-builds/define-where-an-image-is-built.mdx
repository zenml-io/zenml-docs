ZenML executes pipeline steps sequentially in the active Python environment when running locally. However, with remote [orchestrators](/stack-components/orchestrators) or [step operators](/stack-components/step-operators), ZenML builds [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images to run your pipeline in an isolated, well-defined environment.

By default, execution environments are created locally in the client environment using the local Docker client. However, this requires Docker installation and permissions. ZenML offers [image builders](/stack-components/image-builders), a special [stack component](../../../stack-components/component-guide.mdx), allowing users to build and push Docker images in a different specialized _image builder environment_.

Note that even if you don't configure an image builder in your stack, ZenML still uses the [local image builder](../../../stack-components/image-builders/local.mdx) to retain consistency across all builds. In this case, the image builder environment is the same as the [client environment](/usage/project-setup/configure-python-environments#client-environment-or-the-runner-environment).

You don't need to directly interact with any image builder in your code. As long as the image builder that you want to use is part of your active [ZenML stack](../../../user-guide/guides/production-guide/understand-stacks.mdx), it will be used automatically by any component that needs to build container images.
