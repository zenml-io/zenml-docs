title: Attach metadata to steps
subtitle: >-
  You might want to log metadata and have that be attached to a specific step
  during the course of your work.
slug: usage/resource-data-management/track-metrics-metadata/attach-metadata-to-steps
---


This is possible by using the `log_step_metadata` method. This method allows you to attach a dictionary of key-value pairs as metadata to a step. The metadata can be any JSON-serializable value, including custom classes such as `Uri`, `Path`, `DType`, and `StorageSize`.

You can call this method from within a step or from outside. If you call it from within it will attach the metadata to the step and run that is currently being executed.

```py

from zenml import step, log_step_metadata, ArtifactConfig, get_step_context
from typing import Annotated
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.base import ClassifierMixin

@step
def train_model(dataset: pd.DataFrame) -> Annotated[ClassifierMixin, ArtifactConfig(name="sklearn_classifier", is_model_artifact=True)]:
    """Train a model"""
    # Fit the model and compute metrics
    classifier = RandomForestClassifier().fit(dataset)
    accuracy, precision, recall = ...

    # Log metadata at the step level
    # This associates the metadata with the ZenML step run
    log_step_metadata(
        metadata={
            "evaluation_metrics": {
                "accuracy": accuracy,
                "precision": precision,
                "recall": recall
            }
        },
    )
    return classifier
```

If you call it from outside you can attach the metadata to a specific step run from any pipeline and step. This is useful if you want to attach the metadata after you've run the step.
```py

from zenml import log_step_metadata
# run some step

# subsequently log the metadata for the step
log_step_metadata(
    metadata={
        "some_metadata": {"a_number": 3}
    },
    pipeline_name_id_or_prefix="my_pipeline",
    step_name="my_step",
    run_id="my_step_run_id"
)
```

## Fetching logged metadata

Once metadata has been logged in an [artifact](attach-metadata-to-an-artifact.mdx), [model](attach-metadata-to-a-model.mdx), we can easily fetch the metadata with the ZenML Client:

```py

from zenml.client import Client

client = Client()
step = client.get_pipeline_run().steps["step_name"]

print(step.run_metadata["metadata_key"].value)
```
