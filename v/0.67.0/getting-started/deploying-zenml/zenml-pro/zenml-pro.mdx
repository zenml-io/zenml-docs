### Role-based access control and permissions

Utilizing ZenML Pro provides you with access to a robust control plane that unifies user management and optimizes your workflows. Efficiently manage access and permissions through centralized user administration. Create fine-grained permissions for resources such as stacks, pipelines, models, etc.

See the section on [user management](/v/0.67.0/versions/0.66.0/getting-started/zenml-pro/user-management) to learn more.

We have built the ZenML Pro experience from the ground-up. With ZenML Pro, you get access to a new dashboard, with a better experience. The new dashboard features more functionality such as the [Model Control Plane](/v/0.67.0/versions/0.66.0/user-guide/starter-guide/track-ml-models) and [Artifact Control Plane](/v/0.67.0/versions/0.66.0/user-guide/starter-guide/manage-artifacts).

### Run templates for running your pipelines from the dashboard or the API

ZenML Pro enables you to [create and run templates](/v/0.67.0/versions/0.66.0/how-to/create-and-run-templates). This way, you can use the dashboard or our Client/REST API to run a pipeline with updated configuration which allows you to iterate quickly with minimal friction.

### Triggers, CI/CD, Reports and more

Additionally, ZenML Pro users get exclusive access to an array of cloud-specific features, such as triggers, integrating with your code repository CI/CD system, generating usage reports and more.

Learn more about ZenML Pro on the [ZenML Website](https://zenml.io/pro).
