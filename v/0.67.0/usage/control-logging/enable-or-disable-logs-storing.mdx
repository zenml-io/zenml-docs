title: "Enable or disable logs storage"
description: By default, ZenML uses a logging handler to capture the logs that occur during the execution of a step. Users are free to use the default python logging module or print statements, and ZenML's logging handler will catch these logs and store them.
icon: store-slash

```py
import logging

from zenml import step

@step
def my_step() -> None:
    logging.warning("`Hello`")  # You can use the regular `logging` module.
    print("World.")  # You can utilize `print` statements as well.
```

These logs are stored within the respective artifact store of your stack. You can display the logs in the dashboard as follows:
<Frame caption="Displaying step logs on the dashboard">
  <img src="/images/how-to/stack-47.avif" />
</Frame>

<Note>
    Note that if you are not connected to a cloud artifact store with a service connector configured then you will not be able to view your logs in the dashboard. Read more [here](/v/0.67.0/versions/0.66.0/how-to/control-logging/view-logs-on-the-dasbhoard).
</Note>

If you do not want to store the logs in your artifact store, you can:

1. Disable it by using the `enable_step_logs` parameter either with your `@pipeline` or `@step` decorator:

```py
from zenml import pipeline, step
@step(enable_step_logs=False)  # disables logging for this step
def my_step() -> None:
    ...
@pipeline(enable_step_logs=False)  # disables logging for the entire pipeline
def my_pipeline():
    ...
```
2. Disable it by using the environmental variable `ZENML_DISABLE_STEP_LOGS_STORAGE` and setting it to `true`. This environmental variable takes precedence over the parameters mentioned above. Note this environmental variable needs to be set on the [execution environment](/v/0.67.0/versions/0.66.0/how-to/configure-python-environments#execution-environments), i.e., on the orchestrator level:

```py
docker_settings = DockerSettings(environment={"ZENML_DISABLE_STEP_LOGS_STORAGE": "true"})

# Either add it to the decorator
@pipeline(settings={"docker": docker_settings})
def my_pipeline() -> None:
    my_step()

# Or configure the pipelines options
my_pipeline = my_pipeline.with_options(
    settings={"docker": docker_settings}
)
```
