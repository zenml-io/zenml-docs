<Info>
  This is a [ZenML Pro](https://zenml.io/pro) only feature. Please [sign up here](https://cloud.zenml.io) get access. OSS users can only trigger a pipeline by calling the pipeline function inside their runner script.
</Info>

Triggering a pipeline from the REST API **only** works if you've created at least one run template for that pipeline.

As a pre-requisite, you need a pipeline name. After you have it, there are three calls that need to be made in order to trigger a pipeline from the REST API:

1. `GET /pipelines?name=<PIPELINE_NAME>` \-> This returns a response, where a \<PIPELINE_ID> can be copied
2. `GET /run_templates?pipeline_id=<PIPELINE_ID>` \-> This returns a list of responses where a \<TEMPLATE_ID> can be chosen
3. `POST /run_templates/<TEMPLATE_ID>/runs` \-> This runs the pipeline. You can pass the [PipelineRunConfiguration](https://sdkdocs.zenml.io/latest/core%5Fcode%5Fdocs/core-config/#zenml.config.pipeline%5Frun%5Fconfiguration.PipelineRunConfiguration) in the body

## A worked example

Here is an example. Let's say would we like to re-run a pipeline called `training`. We first query the `/pipelines` endpoint:


```Bash

curl -X 'GET' \
  '<YOUR_ZENML_SERVER_URL>/api/v1/pipelines?hydrate=false&name=training' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>'
```
<Frame caption="Identifying the pipeline ID

</Frame>


We can take the ID from any object in the list of responses. In this case, the \<PIPELINE_ID> is `c953985e-650a-4cbf-a03a-e49463f58473` in the response.

After this, we take the pipeline ID and call the `/run_templates?pipeline_id=<PIPELINE_ID>` API:

```shell
curl -X 'GET' \
  '<YOUR_ZENML_SERVER_URL>/api/v1/run_templates?hydrate=false&logical_operator=and&page=1&size=20&pipeline_id=b826b714-a9b3-461c-9a6e-1bde3df3241d' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>'
```

We can now take the \<TEMPLATE_ID> from this response. Here it is `b826b714-a9b3-461c-9a6e-1bde3df3241d`.

<Frame caption="Identifying the template ID

</Frame>

Finally, we can use the template ID to trigger the pipeline with a different configuration:

```Bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  '<YOUR_ZENML_SERVER_URL>/api/v1/run_templates/b826b714-a9b3-461c-9a6e-1bde3df3241d/runs' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>' \
  -d '{
  "steps": {"model_trainer": {"parameters": {"model_type": "rf"}}}
}'
```

A positive response means your pipeline has been re-triggered with a different config!
