ZenML executes pipeline steps sequentially in the active Python environment when running locally. However, with remote [orchestrators](v/0.66.0/user-guide/guides/production-guide/cloud-orchestration) or [step operators](v/0.66.0/stack-components/step-operators), ZenML builds [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images to run your pipeline in an isolated, well-defined environment.

This section discusses how to control this dockerization process.
