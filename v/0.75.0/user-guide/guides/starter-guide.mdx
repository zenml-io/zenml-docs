Throughout this guide, we'll cover essential topics including:

* [Creating your first ML pipeline](/latest/versions/0.66.0/user-guide/starter-guide/create-an-ml-pipeline)
* [Understanding caching between pipeline steps](/latest/versions/0.66.0/user-guide/starter-guide/cache-previous-executions)
* [Managing data and data versioning](/latest/versions/0.66.0/user-guide/starter-guide/manage-artifacts)
* [Tracking your machine learning models](/latest/versions/0.66.0/user-guide/starter-guide/track-ml-models)

Before jumping in, make sure you have a Python environment ready and `virtualenv` installed to follow along with ease. By the end, you will have completed a [starter project](/latest/versions/0.66.0/user-guide/starter-guide/starter-project), marking the beginning of your journey into MLOps with ZenML.

Let this guide be not only your introduction to ZenML but also a foundational asset in your MLOps toolkit. Prepare your development environment, and let's get started!
