The orchestrator is an essential component in any MLOps stack as it is responsible for running your machine learning pipelines. To do so, the orchestrator provides an environment that is set up to execute the steps of your pipeline. It also makes sure that the steps of your pipeline only get executed once all their inputs (which are outputs of previous steps of your pipeline) are available.

<Info>
  Many of ZenML's remote orchestrators build [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images in order to transport and execute your pipeline code. If you want to learn more about how Docker images are built by ZenML, check out [this guide](/latest/versions/0.66.0/how-to/customize-docker-builds).

### When to use it

The orchestrator is a mandatory component in the ZenML stack. It is used to store all artifacts produced by pipeline runs, and you are required to configure it in all of your stacks.

### Orchestrator Flavors

Out of the box, ZenML comes with a `local` orchestrator already part of the default stack that runs pipelines locally. Additional orchestrators are provided by integrations:

If you would like to see the available flavors of orchestrators, you can use the command:

```bash
zenml orchestrator flavor list
```

### How to use it

You don't need to directly interact with any ZenML orchestrator in your code. As long as the orchestrator that you want to use is part of your active [ZenML stack](/latest/versions/0.66.0/user-guide/production-guide/understand-stacks), using the orchestrator is as simple as executing a Python file that [runs a ZenML pipeline](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/release/0.66.0/docs/book/versions/0.66.0/user-guide/starter-guide/starter-guide.md):

```bash
python file_that_runs_a_zenml_pipeline.py
```

#### Inspecting Runs in the Orchestrator UI

If your orchestrator comes with a separate user interface (for example Kubeflow, Airflow, Vertex), you can get the URL to the orchestrator UI of a specific pipeline run using the following code snippet:

```bash
from zenml.client import Client

pipeline_run = Client().get_pipeline_run("")

orchestrator_url = pipeline_run.run_metadata["orchestrator_url"].value
```

#### Specifying per-step resources

If your steps require the orchestrator to execute them on specific hardware, you can specify them on your steps as described [here](/latest/versions/0.66.0/how-to/use-configuration-files/runtime-configuration).

If your orchestrator of choice or the underlying hardware doesn't support this, you can also take a look at [step operators](/latest/versions/0.66.0/stack-components/step-operators).
