## Organizations, Tenants, and Roles

ZenML Pro arranges various aspects of your work experience around the concept of an **Organization**. This is the top-most level structure within the ZenML Cloud environment. Generally, an organization contains a group of users and one or more **tenants**. Tenants are individual, isolated deployments of the ZenML server.

Every user in an organization has a distinct role. Each role configures what they can view, modify, and their level of involvement in collaborative tasks. A role thus helps determine the level of access that a user has within an organization.

The `admin` has all permissions on an organization. They are allowed to add members, adjust the billing information and assign roles. The `editor` can still fully manage tenants and members but is not allowed to access the subscription information or delete the organization. The `viewer` Role allows you to allow users to access the tenants within the organization with only view permissions.

## Inviting Team Members

Inviting users to your organization to work on the organization's tenants is easy. Simply click `Add Member` in the Organization settings, and give them an initial Role. The User will be sent an invitation email. If a user is part of an organization, they can utilize their login on all tenants they have authority to access.
