A pipeline can be run via Python like this:

```py
@step  # Just add this decorator
def load_data() -> dict:
    training_data = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
    labels = [0, 1, 0]
    return {'features': training_data, 'labels': labels}


@step
def train_model(data: dict) -> None:
    total_features = sum(map(sum, data['features']))
    total_labels = sum(data['labels'])

    # Train some model here

    print(f"Trained model using {len(data['features'])} data points. "
          f"Feature sum is {total_features}, label sum is {total_labels}")


@pipeline  # This function combines steps together
def simple_ml_pipeline():
    dataset = load_data()
    train_model(dataset)
```

You can now run this pipeline by simply calling the function:


```py
simple_ml_pipeline()
```

However, there are other ways to trigger a pipeline, specifically a pipeline with a remote stack (remote orchestrator, artifact store, and container registry).
