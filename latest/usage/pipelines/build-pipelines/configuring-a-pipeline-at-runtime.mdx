It is often the case that there is a need to run a pipeline with a different configuration. In this case, you should in most cases use the [pipeline.with\_options](latest/usage/project-setup/use-configuration-files) method. You can do this:

1. Either by explicitly configuring options like `with_options(steps="trainer": {"parameters": {"param1": 1}})`
2. Or by passing a YAML file using `with_options(config_file="path_to_yaml_file")`.

You can learn more about these options [here](latest/usage/project-setup/use-configuration-files).

However, there is one exception: if you would like to trigger a pipeline from the client or another pipeline, you would need to pass the `PipelineRunConfiguration` object. Learn more about this [here](latest/usage/pipelines/trigger-pipelines/trigger-a-pipeline-from-another).
